Be inspired by [this stunning quadcopter demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2itwFJCgFQ "Robotics future")
and a lot of recent projects on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/discover/advanced?category_id=338&sort=magic), I start
looking at promising robotic programming field.

This is my first robot kit from Parallax, a great toy with lot of possibilities. Currently I get used to learning basic wiring and assembling, bread board
and fundamental electronic components. It is really fun.

My next plan:

* Work with ultrasonic sensor (((Ping, Infrared detector, Servo encoder
* Write my own library
* Remote control the activity bot
* Use [JonnyFive framework](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five "Stunning")
